## Testing Your Video

Before going live, test with 3 people:

1. **Show to a colleague** - Do they understand the value?
2. **Show to a friend (not in travel)** - Can they follow along?
3. **Show to a customer** - Does it make them want to try it?

Ask them:
- "What was unclear?"
- "What stood out most?"
- "Would you try it after watching?"

Adjust based on feedback!

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to show my face?**
A: No! Screen recording only is fine. But showing your face builds trust (optional).

**Q: What if I make a mistake while recording?**
A: Just pause, start the sentence again. You can edit out mistakes later.

**Q: Should I use my real business or a demo account?**
A: Use a demo account with fake customer data to avoid exposing real info.

**Q: How do I make AI generation faster for the video?**
A: You can't speed up AI, but you can add a "15 seconds later..." text overlay during editing.

**Q: Can I hire someone to make this?**
A: Yes! Fiverr has video editors for $50-150. But DIY is free and more authentic.

**Q: What resolution should I record at?**
A: 1080p (1920x1080) is perfect. 4K is overkill for a demo.
