# Pricing System - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Database Structure ‚úÖ
- **13 pricing tables created** in `tqa_db` database
- Tables: hotels, hotel_pricing, tours, tour_pricing, vehicles, vehicle_pricing, guides, guide_pricing, entrance_fees, entrance_fee_pricing, meal_pricing, extra_expenses, currency_rates
- All foreign key relationships configured
- Multi-tenant isolation with `organization_id`
- Seasonal pricing support with date ranges
- Currency support (EUR, USD, GBP, TRY)

### 2. Sample Data ‚úÖ
- **41 test records** inserted for Istanbul Travel Agency (org_id=1)
- 3 hotels with seasonal pricing and meal plans (BB/HB/FB/AI)
- 3 tours (SIC and Private) with group slab pricing
- 5 vehicles with city-specific airport transfers
- 5 guides across multiple cities and languages
- 10 entrance fees (official Turkish Ministry of Culture prices)
- 5 restaurant meal pricing entries
- 10 extra expenses (parking, tolls, tips, services)

### 3. API Endpoints - READ (GET) ‚úÖ
All endpoints require JWT authentication and filter by `organizationId`:

| Endpoint | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `GET /api/pricing/hotels` | Fetch hotels with pricing | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET /api/pricing/tours` | Fetch tours with SIC/Private pricing | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET /api/pricing/vehicles` | Fetch vehicles with rentals & transfers | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET /api/pricing/guides` | Fetch guides by city/language | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET /api/pricing/entrance-fees` | Fetch entrance fees | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET /api/pricing/meals` | Fetch restaurant pricing | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET /api/pricing/extras` | Fetch extra expenses | ‚úÖ Working |

### 4. Frontend Pages ‚úÖ
All 7 pricing pages are connected to database:

- `/dashboard/pricing/hotels` - ‚úÖ Fetches from API
- `/dashboard/pricing/tours` - ‚úÖ Fetches from API
- `/dashboard/pricing/vehicles` - ‚úÖ Fetches from API
- `/dashboard/pricing/guides` - ‚úÖ Fetches from API
- `/dashboard/pricing/entrance-fees` - ‚úÖ Fetches from API
- `/dashboard/pricing/meals` - ‚úÖ Fetches from API
- `/dashboard/pricing/extras` - ‚úÖ Fetches from API

**All hardcoded sample data removed** - Pages now show real database data

### 5. Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **45 automated tests** covering all aspects
- Test file: `tests/test-pricing-system.ts`
- Admin dashboard UI: `/admin/dashboard/tests`
- API endpoint: `GET /api/admin/run-tests`
- **100% pass rate** ‚úÖ

Test Categories:
- Database Structure (13 tests)
- Data Integrity (17 tests)
- Sample Data (5 tests)
- Data Types & Constraints (10 tests)

### 6. Security ‚úÖ
- JWT token authentication on all endpoints
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Organization-based filtering
- Admin-only access to system tests

## ‚è≥ PENDING FEATURES (User Requested)

### Edit Functionality (CREATE/UPDATE)
Currently, pricing data is **VIEW ONLY**. Need to add:

#### Required API Endpoints (POST/PUT):
- [ ] `POST /api/pricing/hotels` - Add new hotel
- [ ] `PUT /api/pricing/hotels/:id` - Update hotel
- [ ] `POST /api/pricing/hotels/:id/pricing` - Add seasonal pricing
- [ ] `PUT /api/pricing/hotels/:hotelId/pricing/:pricingId` - Update pricing
- [ ] Similar endpoints for all 7 categories (tours, vehicles, guides, etc.)

#### Required UI Components:
- [ ] "Edit" button functionality (currently just displays but doesn't work)
- [ ] Modal/form for editing pricing
- [ ] Form validation
- [ ] Success/error messages
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates

### Delete Functionality (DELETE)
Currently, pricing data **cannot be deleted**. Need to add:

#### Required API Endpoints (DELETE):
- [ ] `DELETE /api/pricing/hotels/:id` - Archive hotel
- [ ] `DELETE /api/pricing/hotels/:hotelId/pricing/:pricingId` - Archive pricing
- [ ] Similar endpoints for all 7 categories

#### Required UI Components:
- [ ] "Delete/Archive" button functionality
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Soft delete (status = 'archived') vs hard delete
- [ ] Undo functionality (optional)

### Add New Records
Currently, "Add Hotel", "Add Tour" etc. buttons exist but don't work. Need:

## üìä CURRENT SYSTEM CAPABILITIES

### What Works Now ‚úÖ
1. **Login System** - Admin and tour operator login
2. **View All Pricing** - All 7 categories display real database data
3. **Filter Data** - By city, season, type, language, etc.
4. **Multi-Currency** - Prices stored in EUR/USD/GBP/TRY
5. **Seasonal Pricing** - Different rates for different date ranges
6. **Multi-Tenant** - Each tour operator sees only their data
7. **System Tests** - Admin can verify system integrity
8. **Team Management** - Tour operators can manage staff

### What Doesn't Work Yet ‚ùå
1. **Adding new pricing** - Forms exist but no backend
2. **Editing existing pricing** - Buttons exist but not functional
3. **Deleting pricing** - Cannot remove or archive records
4. **Excel Import/Export** - Buttons present but not implemented
5. **Price History** - Database supports it but no UI
6. **Currency Conversion** - Rates in DB but not used yet

2. Implement PUT endpoints for updating pricing
3. Implement DELETE endpoints for archiving pricing
4. Add form validation and error handling

### Phase 2: UI Enhancement
1. Create modal forms for add/edit operations
2. Add confirmation dialogs for delete
3. Implement optimistic UI updates
4. Add success/error toast notifications

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Excel import/export functionality
2. Price history view
3. Currency conversion
4. Bulk operations
5. Pricing templates
